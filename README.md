# Gemochat

Gemochat enables standard, consistent, and fast candidate evaluation for external interviewers by leveraging the interviewing experience the team has spent years fine-tuning and provide real-time questions that map to specific attributes on scorecards.
The software makes use of the Twilio Programmable Video API to provide live audio and video calls to the users.
